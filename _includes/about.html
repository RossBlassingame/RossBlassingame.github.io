                <p>I'm currently a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Denver, focusing on foundational privacy frameworks and cross-platform tooling for device operating systems like FireOS and AOSP, impacting millions of users. Previously, I was at Charles Schwab for over four years (2017-2021), progressing from Intern to Software Engineer III while contributing to the Schwab Intelligent Portfolios platform and internal tools using technologies like .NET Core and Angular. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder (2018).</p>

                <p>When I'm not building software, you can probably find me outdoors. I enjoy hiking (I've done 30 fourteeners), running (currently training for a marathon), hunting and fishing. Indoors, I enjoy lifting weights, reading, and playing PS5 (currently working on RDR2).</p>
